1. Executive Summary
In a world of ever-increasing living costs, a simple vacation is becoming an unaffordable luxury for a growing segment of the population. In the EU alone, over 27% of citizens could not afford a one-week holiday trip in 2023. BungalowParkseurope was created to tackle this barrier head-on. Our vision is a global network of stylish, sustainable, and, above all, affordable container bungalow parks, making high-quality getaways accessible to everyone.
To finance, operate, and scale this ambitious project, we are introducing the Social Network Coin (SO-NET-CO). SO-NET-CO is more than just a cryptocurrency; it is the heart and currency of our entire ecosystem. The token/coin is used to finance new parks and acts as the exclusive means of payment for overnight stays, gastronomy, and services inside and outside the parks (e.g., with strategic partners such as restaurants or sports facilities, etc.). In contrast to purely speculative digital assets, the value of SO-NE-CO is directly linked to the success and growth of a real, tangible business model. This white paper outlines our vision, economic model, and strategic roadmap for establishing SO-NE-CO as the leading cryptocurrency at the intersection of tourism, community, and blockchain technology.
2. The Problem: The Widening "Vacation Divide" in Europe and Beyond
The desire for relaxation and new experiences is a fundamental human need. Yet, the reality is starkly different:
    • Soaring Costs: Traditional holiday accommodations, from hotels to vacation rentals, are caught in a relentless price spiral. This systematically excludes families, low-income earners, and young people.
    • Lack of Flexibility: Rigid booking models and high prices for short stays make spontaneous getaways complicated and expensive.
    • Lack of Transparency: Hidden fees and complex pricing structures complicate travel planning and often lead to unpleasant surprises.
The statistics are telling: when 22.8% of people in an economic powerhouse like Germany and 29.9% in a classic holiday destination like Greece cannot afford a one-week vacation, it signals a societal challenge that demands innovative solutions.





3. Our Solution: A Symbiosis of Real-World Infrastructure and Digital Currency
We address this problem with a dual-pronged approach that intelligently merges the physical and digital worlds.
3.1 The Concept: BungalowParkseurope – Holidays for Everyone
BungalowParkseurope is the physical manifestation of our vision. We are building a global network of bungalow parks based on a modular and highly efficient concept:
    • Locations: Strategically chosen sites in attractive tourist regions, initially across Europe. Each park will comprise 20-40 units to maintain a personal and community-focused atmosphere.
    • Accommodations: Modern, high-quality converted container bungalows (approx. 18-20m²). Each bungalow is a self-contained living unit equipped with everything needed for a comfortable stay: a comfy bed, a full wet room (shower/toilet), a compact dining area, and a private terrace.
    • Pricing: Radically simple and affordable. With prices of just €9.99 per adult and €4.99 per child per night, we are redefining "budget travel." Long-term rental options at attractive rates are also part of the concept.
    • Ecosystem: Each park will feature communal areas and optional dining facilities, all payable with SO-NET-CO.


3.2 The Engine: Social Network Coin (SO-NET-CO) – The Ecosystem Token
SO-NE-CO is the digital currency that powers this ecosystem. Blockchain technology allows us to create a transparent, efficient, and community-driven model.
4. The Utility of SO-NET-CO
SO-NE-CO is a pure utility token whose value is driven by its diverse applications within the BungalowParkseurope network:
    1. Funding Mechanism: The public sale of SO-NET-CO directly finances the construction and expansion of the bungalow parks. Every coin sold contributes to the growth of our real-world assets.
    2. Exclusive Payment Method: SO-NET-CO will be the primary currency within the parks. Bookings, restaurant visits, activities, and other services will be paid for seamlessly and cost-effectively with SO-NET-CO. Users paying with SO-NET-CO will benefit from potential discounts and special offers.
    3. Investor Benefits (Tier System): We reward the trust of our early and major supporters. Depending on the volume of SO-NET-CO held, investors will receive tiered benefits, ranging up to free holiday in our parks.
    4. Social Media Liquidity Provider (Future): The long-term vision is to establish SO-NET-CO as a means of payment for services and goods within the broader social media landscape, expanding its utility beyond the tourism sector.
5. Tokenomics: The Economic Model of SO-NET-CO
A well-thought-out and transparent economic model (Tokenomics) is the foundation for the long-term growth and stability of the entire ecosystem. Our model is designed to align the interests of users, developers, and the project team.

8. Value Stability & Risk Analysis
8.1 Stability Through Real-World Value
Unlike many purely speculative cryptocurrencies, SO-NET-CO possesses a fundamental intrinsic value backed by a real-world business model. The demand for SO-NET-CO is not primarily driven by market speculation, but by the tangible need for bookings and services within the growing BungalowParkseurope network. Every new park we build increases the potential demand for the token. This link to physical assets and a concrete use case creates a foundation for potentially more stable value appreciation compared to meme coins or pure protocol tokens. SO-NE-CO is the key to a real product—and the value of that key grows with the product's attractiveness and scale.
8.2 Risk Assessment
We believe in transparency and wish to disclose potential risks openly:
    • Market Risk: Like all cryptocurrencies, the price of SO-NET-CO is subject to market volatility, which can be influenced by factors beyond our control.
    • Regulatory Risk: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is evolving. Future legal changes could impact the project. We are working with legal experts to ensure compliance.
    • Operational Risk: Delays in construction, rising material costs, or challenges in land acquisition could affect the roadmap's timeline.
    • Competitive Risk: The budget accommodation market is competitive. Our unique selling proposition lies in the combination of price, modern design, and innovative crypto integration.






9. Trademark, Design, and Legal Protection

    • Trademark Protection: The brand names "Social Network Coin (SO-NET-CO)" and "BungalowParkseurope," along with their associated logos, will be registered as trademarks in relevant jurisdictions.
    • Design Protection: The unique design of our container bungalows, including both the exterior appearance and interior layout, will be protected as a registered design to secure our aesthetic and functional innovation.
    • Copyright: All content, including this whitepaper, our website, marketing materials, and software code, is protected by copyright.
These comprehensive intellectual property rights ensure that BungalowParkseurope and SO-NE-CO will remain a distinctive and valuable brand in the global tourism market.
